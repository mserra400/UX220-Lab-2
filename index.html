            I love to read poetry. I have a book by Rupi Kaur called The Sun and Her Flowers.

            One of my favourite quotes I read was “i stand
            on the sacrifices
            of a million women before me
            thinking
            what can i do
            to make this mountain taller
            so the women after me
            can see farther
            - legacy”.
